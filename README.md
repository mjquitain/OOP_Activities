# OOP Activities

Welcome to my **OOP Activities**! This repository contains multiple standalone Java projects, each organized into its own folder.

## Repository Structure

Each folder in this repository represents a **separate Java project**. Here's what you need to know:

1. **Independent Projects:**  
   Each folder is a self-contained Java project, complete with its own source files, dependencies, and configuration.

2. **Directory Overview:**  
   - `Homework_4`: Implementing Abstraction in Java
